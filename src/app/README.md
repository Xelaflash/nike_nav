# Nike.com Navigation Reproduction

This repository is a reproduction of Nike's navigation components, focusing on their seamless scroll animations.
I made this repo for learning and practicing how to implement scroll animations in a real-world scenario.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/app`: Contains the main application files including the layout and page components.
- `src/components`: Contains all the reusable components used in the application such as the `NavigationBar`, `Header`, `ProductGrid`, etc.

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript**
- **Next.js** (probably overkill but faster to get started)
- **PandaCSS**: CSS-in-JS library with build time generated styles, RSC compatible, multi-variant support. [PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/)
- **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React that makes it easy to create complex animations. (used only for the scroll hook)
- **BIOME**: A eslint / prettier new alternative [BIOME](https://biomejs.dev/)


## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any improvements or different way to implement the scroll animations.
